Data from downtown Bluetooth detectors arrives in our database after initial filtering by bliptrack. 

There it is grouped into five-minute-bins using the median to reduce the impact of extreme outliers.

The five-minute bins are grouped again into 30-minute bins using weighted average by the number of observations per five-minute-bin and separated by working day and nonworking day. 

The 30-minute data collected before the pilot was plotted as scatterplots and quality checked. Major outliers were noted and removed from the baseline if deemed necessary. 
For example on Queen Street, a major slowdown was identified at midnight, which had a major impact on the baseline. This was due to Nuit Blanche so Queen University to Yonge was listed to have September 30th and October 1st removed from its baseline.

The dates and segments that were removed are: 

1. Queen EB University to Yonge: 2017-09-24, 2017-09-30, 2017-10-01
2. Queen WB Yonge to University: 2017-09-30, 2017-10-01
3. Queen WB Spadina to Bathurst: 2017-09-19
4. Adelaide EB Jarvis to Parliament: 2017-10-30, 2017-10-31, 2017-11-01
5. Front EB Jarvis to Parliament: 2017-09-16
6. Dufferin SB Queen to King: 2017-11-05
7. Jarvis NB Front to King: 2017-09-16
8. Jarvis NB King to Queen: 22017-09-17
9. Parliament NB Queen to Dundas: 2017-09-24

The 30-minute data was then aggregated by time period, and pre-pilot data were averaged to get a baseline for a given period during the weekend or week.
